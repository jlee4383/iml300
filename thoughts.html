    <p>Jenny Odell’s “How to Internet” surveys the past, present, and future of Internet usage in terms of its ever-evolving purpose and means of connectivity. Filled with the nostalgia of pre-2010 Internet, it was an interesting read that highlights the web as a metaphorical information superhighway system or portal where people can transport themselves into a world of instantaneity or cyber community for interaction—all of which is up to the user. Laurel Schwulst expands on this idea of the Internet as a fluid world determined by its user, advocating for individuals to create their own websites (which is also in response to a larger concern pertaining to the prevalence of profit-seeking large corporations running the Internet). More specifically, she explains how they are opportunities for artists to create their own world. I really saw these ideas come into fruition when I explored Molly Soda’s website, which was a chaotic but aesthetic glimpse into her own world of female body imagery, satirical Internet videos, commentative digital art pieces, and wacky gifs.

        <br>
        <li>Considering the negative affects the Internet can have, why don't we see PSA videos on safe Internet usage like those back then? </li>
        <li>Does this say anything about our current outlook on the Internet?</li>
        <li>Have we gotten so used to it that these know hows and etiquettes are frivolous?</li>

    <h3><i>2/11 Lecture Reflection:</i></h3>
    <p>As someone who knows a bit about the history of computers but very little about how the Internet functions, this was a very interesting and informative lecture video. I don’t think I’ve ever tried to really ask myself what I think the Internet is; before this video I definitely viewed it as something similar to the cloud idea—that it was this invisible space of connectivity above us that works in very mysterious ways. But I was able to see a clear picture of what happens when I send an email since the supplementary video unpacked how the internet works with easy-to-understand diagrams and metaphors. Moreover, I was surprised to hear that the number of female programmers when the digital computer first came out was a lot more than the number today. With the stronger prevalence of feminism these days, you would think that there’d be more women working in the tech industry. But I guess that goes to show how strong these harmful “computers are for boys” narrative can affect the opportunities of women.</p>

    <p>“Black Gooey Universe” traces the rise of tech industries in Silicon Valley, which were originally funded by the government for national defense purposes, to explain the popularization. commercialization and consumerism of personal computers. Specifically, emphasizing how the graphical user interface (GUI)—an abstracted representation of a person’s relationship to a machine—is a significant development for this change, the article discusses the history of its formats. However, it also critically analyzes this development in racial contexts, arguing how the switch from naturally black to artificial white backdrops are a conceptual reflection of white male dominance working towards the erasure of blackness. Olia Lialina’s “Rich User Experience, UX and the Desktopization of War” takes an interesting perspective on the increasing automatization of interface, which aims to enrich user experience. Yet Lialina challenges this idea to argue how these “innovations” have actually denied user experience by hiding programmability, scripting user behaviors and limiting our decision-making. She also advocates against making interface interactivity easier and gamifying war because it is unnecessary and dangerous to lessen the reality of computer-operated war actions.

        <br>
        <li>To what extent have big corporations had a role in developing RUEs?</li>
        <li>Do you think less automatization could mean more freedoms of expression on the Internet? And could this do more harm than good (e.g. dislike button)?</li>
        <li>Have we been reduced to simple, robotic gestures on the Internet? (is a “like” really a “like” or do we just do it because we’ve been programmed to?)</li>

    <p>Heather Dewey-Hagborg’s talk deliberates the gray legal zones of DNA surveillance in an era of increasing genetic silence. Specifically, it is her artwork—which includes the gathering of random DNA in public spaces—that pushes boundaries of invasions of privacy as she uses the physical information extracted from collected DNA to create virtual portraits and sculptures. Lauren McCarthy, on the other hand, explores themes of surveillance in terms of its presence in everyday life. One of her projects, Following, analyzes technology’s impact on our physical interactions with an experimental investigation on why people have a liking to be “followed” on social media (where they are transparent with certain aspects of their life), but not followed in person. In her article, Sydette Harry argues how historical surveillance of black women (and the denial of their consent) continues to pervade to this day, but on new fronts including the cyber sphere. However, it is a matter of cultural standards that have bred this surveillance which continues to abuse black women by misrepresenting their bodies, excluding them from participating, and willfully erasing them from social discourses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Dewey-Hagborg talks about the possibility of governments infringing on our genetic privacy. What about large corporations (e.g. Facebook) that have access to user data and personal information?</li>
        <li>Why do you think people enjoy gaining “followers” and “likes” yet abhor at the idea of a physical follower? How has the internet/social media altered our social values?</li>
        <li>What are some initiatives we can take to reverse the exclusion of black communities that results from this unjust cultural surveillance?</li>

    <p>In her talk, An Xiao Mina discusses the history of cat portrayal and their visual cultural value. She explains how thanks to the Internet, these images have translated into icons for meme culture and explores why they perform so well on online content. I found it very interesting when Mina mentioned the “cute cat theory,” which argues that the dissemination of cat content has as much influence as the dissemination of activist messages, and can be a vehicle for those messages when activism becomes censored. I thought these were very thoughtful insights on the cat-related memes in events like Hong Kong’s democratic demonstrations and the 2016 presidential election.
        <br>Hito Steyerl describes the various conditions of a “poor image” (e.g. low resolution, slow, a preview, compressed, misspelled, etc.) in terms of the neoliberal restruction in media production and digital technology. She explains how these images can be a purposeful artistic choice—whether that be in cinema, video essays or experimental films. By explaining various conditions in detail, Steyerl effectively conveys that poor images are an aesthetic of visual importance that defies and doesn’t conform. It itself is reality.
        <br>Using a very visually relevant medium, Rosa Menkman’s “Glitch Studies Manifesto” explores the elitist obsession for upgrading and perfection, where cost efficiency is becoming a more prevalent factor in technology. Menkman takes a strong position to defy the negative assumptions surrounding the glitch, rather celebrating how it can show destruction change into the creation of something new and original. And like Steryerl, she argues to transcend the boundaries of functionality and conformity, to create new paths in “noise artifacts” and other genres of glitch art.
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Would you consider memes their own visual language?</li>
        <li>How would you describe how Apple, Samsung and other large tech brands contribute to upgrade culture?</li>
        <li>It seems like glitch is becoming a more popular aesthetic choice in media, especially considering the return of 80s and 90s styles. Irrespective of these trends, do you think glitch art would’ve still made some kind of comeback?</li>

    <p>At the center of her work “Afro-now-ism,” Dinkins revisions a current future beyond systemic oppression to press questions about how we discern humanity from the rest of the world. In context to our increasing engagement with technology and our ancient bacterial roots, she emphasizes a need to redefine what it means to be a member of society and reconceive the current systems of power that threaten communities perceived as different because there is so much at stake. In her talk, Joy Buolamwini discusses her own mission to combat one of these unseen systems of oppression—what she calls the “the coded gaze,” algorithmic biases that creates exclusion and discrimination. She specifically mentions her own exclusionary experience when facial recognition software didn’t recognize her face and her realization that they don’t detect darker skin tones. Since developing this software involves “teaching” a computer by the creators themselves, Buolamwini thus argues that there needs to be more inclusive coding practices. Mimi Onuoha talks about how data collection—emphasizing the practices and process—can help spread more accurate information to society. In her aim to reunite artifacts with the process of collection, Onuoha has done many interesting projects. Pathways, involved several months of mobile data collection to gain insight into the lives of 4 different groups. Onuoha’s projects exhibit how certain types of data can inform and reveal a lot about specific kinds of people.
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Why do you think the police uses facial recognition software even when it proved to be faulty and is not audited for accuracy? </li>
        <li>In what ways can technology be a useful tool for redefining “human” and recognizing harmful internalized ideas? </li>
        <li>While data collection is shown to be very helpful, where do we draw the line of data collection (in reference to our topics on privacy and surveillance a few weeks ago)?</li>

    <p>In her talk about refiguring digital colonialism, Morehshin Allhyari discusses her art projects, which use an array of platforms, mediums and technologies to archive and document different aspects of life. Primarily, she focuses on the relationship between digital technologies and activism and how they intersect as art activism. Expanding on these ideas, Allhyari has more recently developed her own idea of “additivism” (additives technologies and activism) in works that explore the relationship between ISIS and their dependence on oil—all smaller players in a larger narrative of the West and techno-capitalism. Yaa Addae also recognizes that as our digital presence becomes more prevalent, the vast potential of what can be done in the cybersphere must also be noticed, especially if we are to combat the surveillance and racist algorithms of the Internet. Thus, comes the idea of “data healing,” where trauma from the Internet can be transformed into new technologies that ask us to reconsider the alternatives of engagement. Such examples include digital diasporas and using new social platforms for change. Olivia Ross extends on this discussion of dismantling the colonial contexts in Internet infrastructures by outlining a guideline, based on the concept of the “nonviolent creative code,” for coders to reflect and refine their work. Things to consider honoring include: the land, the body, the small, the people, and the exchange.
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Allhyari discusses the importance of 3D printing and modeling technologies in digital archiving and reconstruction. What are some other upcoming technologies that may also help with decolonization?</li>
        <li>How can we be more cognizant of the colonial contexts in Internet infrastructures?</li>
        <li>What are other areas of “honoring” can be considered in nonviolent creative code?</li>
