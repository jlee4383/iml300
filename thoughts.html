    <h3><i>1/28 Reading Response:</i></h3>
    <p>Jenny Odell’s “How to Internet” surveys the past, present, and future of Internet usage in terms of its ever-evolving purpose and means of connectivity. Filled with the nostalgia of pre-2010 Internet, it was an interesting read that highlights the web as a metaphorical information superhighway system or portal where people can transport themselves into a world of instantaneity or cyber community for interaction—all of which is up to the user. Laurel Schwulst expands on this idea of the Internet as a fluid world determined by its user, advocating for individuals to create their own websites (which is also in response to a larger concern pertaining to the prevalence of profit-seeking large corporations running the Internet). More specifically, she explains how they are opportunities for artists to create their own world. I really saw these ideas come into fruition when I explored Molly Soda’s website, which was a chaotic but aesthetic glimpse into her own world of female body imagery, satirical Internet videos, commentative digital art pieces, and wacky gifs.

        Considering the negative affects the Internet can have, why don't we see PSA videos on safe Internet usage like those back then? Does this say anything about our current outlook on the Internet? Have we gotten so used to it that these know hows and etiquettes are frivolous?

    <h3><i>2/11 Lecture Reflection:</i></h3>
    <p>As someone who knows a bit about the history of computers but very little about how the Internet functions, this was a very interesting and informative lecture video. I don’t think I’ve ever tried to really ask myself what I think the Internet is; before this video I definitely viewed it as something similar to the cloud idea—that it was this invisible space of connectivity above us that works in very mysterious ways. But I was able to see a clear picture of what happens when I send an email since the supplementary video unpacked how the internet works with easy-to-understand diagrams and metaphors. Moreover, I was surprised to hear that the number of female programmers when the digital computer first came out was a lot more than the number today. With the stronger prevalence of feminism these days, you would think that there’d be more women working in the tech industry. But I guess that goes to show how strong these harmful “computers are for boys” narrative can affect the opportunities of women.</p>

    <p>“Black Gooey Universe” traces the rise of tech industries in Silicon Valley, which were originally funded by the government for national defense purposes, to explain the popularization. commercialization and consumerism of personal computers. Specifically, emphasizing how the graphical user interface (GUI)—an abstracted representation of a person’s relationship to a machine—is a significant development for this change, the article discusses the history of its formats. However, it also critically analyzes this development in racial contexts, arguing how the switch from naturally black to artificial white backdrops are a conceptual reflection of white male dominance working towards the erasure of blackness. Olia Lialina’s “Rich User Experience, UX and the Desktopization of War” takes an interesting perspective on the increasing automatization of interface, which aims to enrich user experience. Yet Lialina challenges this idea to argue how these “innovations” have actually denied user experience by hiding programmability, scripting user behaviors and limiting our decision-making. She also advocates against making interface interactivity easier and gamifying war because it is unnecessary and dangerous to lessen the reality of computer-operated war actions.

        To what extent have big corporations had a role in developing RUEs? Do you think less automatization could mean more freedoms of expression on the Internet? And could this do more harm than good (e.g. dislike button)? Have we been reduced to simple, robotic gestures on the Internet? (is a “like” really a “like” or do we just do it because we’ve been programmed to?)
