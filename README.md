[_**Bïdoolgee**_](https://jlee4383.github.io/iml300/project-1/index.html) is an interactive web experience that lets you live as a pigeon in Manhattan. 

### Description

How different would the world appear if seen from way up top at bird’s-eye view? Or from a foot off the ground? Out of this curiosity, I conceived *Bïdoolgee*—an interactive, non-linear narrative that lets us vicariously experience a typical day in the life of a pigeon living in Manhattan, New York (one of my favorite places to visit). *Bïdoolgee*, which is the Romanized Korean word for pigeon, is partly inspired by my own travel adventures to New York. But all the power of this trip goes to the visitor of my page; they get to forge their own path by selecting which delicacies to eat, what activities to partake in, and which landmark or neighborhood to visit next. Especially considering how we are in the midst of a global pandemic that greatly limits our movement, this project’s intention is to invite people to imaginatively transport themselves in a new body and space, through a virtual traveling experience.
